				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>What are you trying to accomplish with this experiment?
					The goal of this project was to create a fun generator that generates futuristic characters and to practice js and html. As the project went on
					I realized I wanted to have a more artistic game-like spin on the generator, so I created an emerging narrative that is not immediately available to
					the eye. The 22nd and 23rd centuries start off with presence of rising technology, lay offs, new jobs, and trends especially surrounding AI and Neurolink. 
					Then in the 24th century, there is implication of war time against AI. Then in the 25th century the war is over, but what happened?
				</p>

				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>Describe in detail what you did technically and how it works?
					For my CMPM147, our first assignment directed us to use a template off of Glitch that generated quests. It works by filling in a random element from a list into a string creating a varying
					generator response. I used this strategy to create a futuristic 25th century character generator that a user can use to generate characters for various forms of media like a game or story.
					We also got to practice html, css, and js where I was able to experiment with box shadows, buttons, colors, and even prompted chatgpt for some base shapes for rocket css art. I had to do a lot
					of adjusting from the chatgpt generated version to get it to look right and how I wanted.
				</p>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Each person that worked on the code should reflect on the process, the difficulties, and the successes of the experiment.
					The biggest difficulty I faced was working from a template cause for certain parts of getting the HTML exactly how I wanted. 
					As for successes, I think the css art and website style is pretty good for the class, especially the glowing box shadow on the generator
					and the buttons. I also cannot find where the bullet point for the home button is hiding but I will have to fix it later. Not a big deal!
