				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>What are you trying to acomplish with this experiment?
					<br>
					This is an infinite Where's Waldo generator. It is a 
					casual clicking game. There is variation in the environment 
					with beaches, oceans, dirt, and grassy regions. There is also 
					a lot of variation in people with several skin colors and over 
					10 clothes colors. Some people spawn with hats (Waldos). People 
					do not spawn in water.“Waldo Tiles” are clickable. When the user 
					clicks on a person with a hat, the tile turns red and the score
					is increased.

				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>Describe in detail what you did technically and how it works?
				<br>
					I used perlin noise to generate biomes with dirt, sand, grass, 
					and oceans. I also used noise to generate variation in the clothing
					and skin tones of the people. I used object mapping to decipher and
					keep track of Waldo tiles, in order to update the global count, and
					change the tiles to red.

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>
					I am highly satisfied with this infinite generator because I was able
					to gamify it. I think that it looks pretty good too for p5js graphics.
					If I were to expand upon it, I would probably move away from p5 graphics 
					and try to incorporate my own art.

				<h2>Statement</h2>
				<p>
				  <br />
				  INFINITY<br>
				  I made an infinite Where's Waldo generator. It is a casual clicking
				  game. There is variation in the environment with beaches, oceans,
				  dirt, and grassy regions. There is also a lot of variation in people
				  with several skin colors and over 10 clothes colors. Some people
				  spawn with hats (Waldos). People do not spawn in water.“Waldo Tiles”
				  are clickable. When the user clicks on a person with a hat, the tile
				  turns red and the score is increased. The world expands up, down,
				  left, and right infinitely. 
				  <br>VARIATION IN SPACE<br> There is variation in
				  the environment with beaches, oceans, dirt, and grassy regions.
				  There is also a lot of variation in people with several skin colors
				  and over 10 clothes colors. Some people spawn with hats (Waldos).
				  People do not spawn in water. 
				  <br>VARIATION IN KEY<br> Different noise
				  generates significantly different terrain to make entirely new
				  worlds and Waldo locations. 
				  <br>SIGNS OF LIFE<br> “Waldo Tiles” are
				  clickable. When the user clicks on a person with a hat, the tile
				  turns red and the score is increased. This progresses time within
				  the game by how many Waldos have been discovered as tiles get marked
				  red and the count increases. Yes, a change in game state/progression
				  does count as a progression in time. If I really wanted to, I could
				  have the water wiggle and I even have the code for it (see
				  https://infinite-shire.glitch.me/ a generator I stopped working on),
				  but I believe that takes away from the game, and as the artistic
				  creator I say that progression in game, is progression in world
				  time. This project was inspired by this inspiring image:
