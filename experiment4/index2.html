            What are you trying to acomplish with this experiment?
            <br />
            This is an infinite oceans generator. It generates an infinite
            sea-scape of boats and islands. I was trying to create feelings of
            calmness for the user and believe I was successful with the way the
            ocean nicely sways and flows. There is also an interactible feature
            to create a splash when the user clicks.

          <p>
            Describe in detail what you did technically and how it works?
            <br />
            The oceans are generated with perlin noise and the tiles tween up
            and down using sine waves and a frame count which clearly creates
            the illusion of the passage of time. There is a smooth transition
            applied between the tiles to create a more aesthetic ocean. The
            islands are also generated with perlin noise. Boats are placed
            randomly using a hash map. The splash on click is a tween.

          <h2>Reflection</h2>
          <p>
            <br />
            I am proud of the work I did in creating a relaxing ocean space that
            can be watched and enjoyed. I feel like there is room for growth in
            this project but but it was difficult with the scope of time alotted
            for 3 generators. I still believe that my achievements are solid and
            that the generator is pretty nice.

          <p>
            <br />
            INFINITY<br />
            I made an infinite ocean generator. It generates an infinite
            sea-scape of boats and islands. I was trying to create feelings of
            calmness for the user and believe I was successful with the way the
            ocean nicely sways and flows. There is also an intractable feature
            to create a splash when the user clicks. The world expands up, down,
            left, and right infinitely.

            <br />VARIATION IN SPACE<br />
            There is a perlin noise ocean with smooth transitions, between
            tiles, islands that spawn on occasion, and boats that spawn on
            occasion. The noise differences between small islands and big ocean
            transitions make for an interesting array if difference, especially
            in the simple way the the ocean flows up and down using sine waves.

            <br />VARIATION IN KEY<br />
            Different noise generates significantly different terrain to make
            entirely new worlds and boat locations and shallow vs deep ocean
            transitions. There are collections of islands, big islands, and
            small islands

            <br />SIGNS OF LIFE<br />
            The ocean tiles all move up and down slowly using sine and time
            progression to simulate waves. There is also an option to click on a
            tile causing the surrounding tiles to splash up and down.
