          <h2>Description</h2>
          <p>
            What are you trying to acomplish with this experiment?
            <br />
            I call this my infinite spacetime generator. It generates an
            infinite space scene of planets, stars, and more. There are red,
            blue, green, yellow, and pink small planets that spawn randomly, big
            orange and red planets, and UFOs that spawn occasionally.
          </p>

          <h2>Technical</h2>
          <p>
            Describe in detail what you did technically and how it works?
            <br />
            stars are generated in random quantities with a hashmap. The UFOs
            are generated with a hashmap and use the millis() function to tween
            up and down in their respective tiles. The orange and red suns use a
            millis() function to rotate a gradient effect around the planet and
            are also placed using a hash map. Sometimes the smaller planets have
            a chance of spawning with a ring. The stars use a hashmap as well
            and generate a random amount of circles of various sizes within each
            tile.

          <h2>Reflection</h2>
          <p>
            <br />
            I think I resonate most with this generator as an artist with a
            reflection of my character in it. The way the stars look is
            genuinely awesome and I think the color variation in planets and how
            they spawn together is very engaging. I like when they overlap too
            and there really is a lot of room for interesting finds as the user
            explores the map.

          <h2>Statement</h2>
          <p>
            <br />
            INFINITY<br> I call this my infinite spacetime generator. It generates
            an infinite space scene of planets, stars, and more. There are red,
            blue, green, yellow, and pink small planets that spawn randomly, big
            orange and red planets, and UFOs that spawn occasionally. The world
            expands up, down, left, and right infinitely. 
			<br>VARIATION IN SPACE<br>
            stars are generated in random quantities with a hashmap. The UFOs
            are generated with a hashmap and use the millis() function to tween
            up and down in their respective tiles. The orange and red suns use a
            millis() function to rotate a gradient effect around the planet and
            are also placed using a hash map. Sometimes the smaller planets have
            a chance of spawning with a ring. The stars use a hashmap as well
            and generate a random amount of circles of various sizes within each
            tile. 
			<br>VARIATION IN KEY Different<br> quantities of stars with hashmaps
            and different planet spawning with various quantities, clusters, and
            colors all help to create a lot of variation in the world. There is
            also the chance of UFOs spawning and even the occasional ring around
            the planet. These smaller variations might not be immediately seen
            and thus take some time to really look deeper into the space
            generator and spend some time exploring infinite space time. 
			<br>SIGNS
            OF LIFE <br>The space generator has UFOs that tween up and down. There
            are also big red and orange planets that have a rotating gradient.
            Both are animated with millis() This project was inspired by this
