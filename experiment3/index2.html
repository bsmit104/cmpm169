				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>What are you trying to acomplish with this experiment?
					<br>
					This here is a overworld river scene generator. It features varying grass and dark charcoal sands with smooth transitions between the. There is also a little village of a varying number of houses frequently. I applied a smooth transition for the winter to spring.
					<br>
					Codes: 
					<br>
					The variation in dirt grass and houses can be seen randomly selected grass 
					<br>
					placeTile(i, j, (4 * pow(random(), g)) | 0, 6);
					<br>
					randomly selected dirt 
					<br>
					placeTile(i, j, (4 * pow(random(), g)) | 0, 9);
					<br>
					randomly selected house of 2 
					<br>
					if (random() < 0.5) { placeTile(i, j, 26, 3); } else { placeTile(i, j, 26, 2);
					<br>
					with a noisey river that spawns one of the couple river tiles placeTile(i, j, (4 * pow(noise(noiseT / 10, i, j / 4 + noiseT), 2)) | 0, 14);
					<br>
					all of which (except the river) alternate with other tiles for the season change using millis() let tileTime = millis() - delay;
					<br>
					Life: I applied a smooth transition for the winter to spring (and back) using millis() to give each tile a lifetime before the change. This shows time passing.

				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>Describe in detail what you did technically and how it works?
				<br>
				using p5.js I was able to tile a canvas using noise and math to generate landscapes. I added cool variation
				with time using the millis function. The generateGrid function creates a grid for 
				a overworld landscape, applying Perlin noise to make a flowing river across the grid. 
				This function uses a constrain function to make the river remains within the grid boundaries and vertical shape.

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>I think I did a good job and I am proud of the work I did. 
					I spent like 27 hours on the whole thing and tried very hard 
					because my last assignment was supposedly not satisfactory. 
					Getting the rooms to not spawn next to or on top of each other 
					sucked but I figured it out after a long time.
					<br>
					My most proud accomplishments are definitely
					the Winter to Spring, non overlapping or adjacent rooms, the millis transitions,
					and the general aesthetic appeal. I was pretty satisfied with the final product and definitely
					deserve a full credit.
